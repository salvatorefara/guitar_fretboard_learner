# Guitar Fretboard Learner

Web app to learn the notes on the guitar fretboard. Practice playing the notes on your instrument as they appear on screen. 
This app will use your device's microphone to pick up each note you play and tell you if it's right or wrong. 
Needless to say, this app will work best in quiet environment.

To start a practice session click the start practice button. Likewise, to end a practice session at any time click the stop practice button. 
During the practice, you will see a note in musical notation on top of the screen. Once you play that note on your instrument, a new note will be shown and so on. 
If the note you play is correct a +1 will be shown briefly on the right of the note, otherwise a -1 will be shown. In the settings you can choose if you want a note to stay until it is played correctly, or if you want it to change even on mistake. 
Right below the musical notation, you will see the note name and the timer. You can remove both note name and/or timer in the settings if you want. 
Below the timer, you will see statistics of your current practice session, including: number of correct answers, number of incorrect answers, average accuracy and average time to correct answer. 

### Performance Statistics
The statistics menu can be opened by clicking the graph icon in the header. This menu will show note-by-note statistics accumulated in all your practice sessions so far. 
Two statistics are currently available: average accuracy and time to correct answer.
